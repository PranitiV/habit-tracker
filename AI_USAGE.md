# AI_USAGE.md

I used AI assistance mainly for **frontend design ideas and layout improvements**.  
The goal was to make the user interface look cleaner and more intuitive without spending too much time on design experimentation.

I used the **Cursor IDE** with built-in AI features to help me:

- Suggest and refine the layout structure for React components (like the dashboard and charts section).
- Improve the visual styling with better color combinations and spacing.
- Get quick explanations or syntax corrections when trying new UI libraries.
- Formatting the CSV and PDF exports.

All logic, API integration, and backend implementation were done manually by me.  
The AI was used as a helper for **UI/UX design inspiration and minor code suggestions** only.
